## Overview

- SQL Query Runner is a React-based application that allows users to:

- Write and execute SQL queries in a syntax-highlighted editor

- Choose from predefined queries categorized by data type (Students, Teachers, Employees)

- View query results in a paginated, sortable table

- Export query results to CSV format

- Toggle between light and dark modes

- Handle large datasets efficiently with optimized performance features

- The interface is designed for usability and scalability with a clean architecture and responsive layout.


  ## Problem Statement
The task required building a SQL query execution interface that:
- Accepts SQL queries through a text area or code editor
- Works without a backend or query engine
- Displays results in a table format
- Supports multiple predefined queries with toggling mechanism
- Handles large datasets efficiently

  ## Solution Approach
I implemented a client-side solution that:
- Uses mock data from predefined categories (Students, Teachers, Employees)
- Simulates SQL query execution through client-side parsing
- Provides an interactive table with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Implements a dropdown system for query selection
- Optimizes performance for large datasets
  

## System Architecture

The SQL Query Runner follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns:


The architecture consists of three main layers:
- **UI Component Layer**: Handles rendering and user interactions
- **State Management Layer**: Manages application state using React Hooks
- **Data Services Layer**: Handles data processing, query execution, and formatting

## Data Model

The application works with a relational data model consisting of several interconnected entities:

This entity relationship diagram shows the structure of the sample datasets available in the application, including:
- Users and their relationship to orders
- Products, categories, and order items
- Employees and departments

## Features

- **Interactive Query Editor**: Write custom SQL queries or choose from predefined templates
- **Multiple Data Categories**: Explore Users, Products, Orders, and Employee datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes for different lighting conditions
- **Advanced Data Table**:
  - Client-side pagination
  - Column sorting
  - Data type formatting
  - Row hover effects
- **Performance Optimized**:
  - Handles datasets with 10,000+ rows
  - Virtualized rendering for large data
  - Memoized component updates
  - Lazy loading of data

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI) 5.x
- **Styling**: SCSS with CSS modules
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context API

## ðŸš€ Performance Metrics

| Metric                    | Value     |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Initial Load Time         | ~1.2s     |
| Time to Interactive       | ~1.5s     |
| First Contentful Paint    | ~800ms    |
| Memory Usage (10k rows)   | ~50MB     |




#### Component Structure
1. **App.jsx**
   - Main application container
   - Manages global state and theme
   - Handles query execution logic

2. **QueryEditor.jsx**
   - Syntax-highlighted SQL editor
   - Predefined query selection
   - Query validation

3. **DataTable.jsx**
   - Custom table component
   - Handles sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - CSV export functionality
     
## Performance Optimizations

1. **Data Virtualization**:
   - Implemented JavaScript Proxy for on-demand data generation
   - Only materializes visible data when needed

2. **Rendering Optimizations**:
   - Memoized expensive computations with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
   - Conditional rendering to reduce DOM operations
   - Dynamic content sizing based on viewport

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Optimized sorting algorithms for large datasets
   - Efficient memory usage with proxy data structures
   - Progressive loading with visual feedback

### Large Dataset Handling

The application can handle datasets with thousands of rows through:
- Efficient pagination controls
- Progressive loading with visual feedback
- Optimized sorting for visible data only
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Responsive Design

- Adapts to different screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- Adjusts layout for optimal viewing on each device
- Maintains functionality across viewport sizes

### Development Decisions

- Chose Material UI for its accessibility features and design system
- Used function components with hooks for better performance
- Implemented data proxies for handling large datasets without memory issues
- Added theme toggle for better user experience in different lighting conditions

## Future Enhancements

- Query history tracking
